# 🦅 Cvision: The Smart Hiring Helper

Imagine you have a big pile of resumes (papers that tell you about a person's job skills) and you need to find the **best person** for a job. Reading them all takes a long time, right?

**Cvision** is a smart robot that reads them for you! 🤖

1.  **You upload resumes** (PDFs).
2.  **You tell it what job you are hiring for** (like "I need a Chef").
3.  **Cvision reads everything** and gives each person a **Score (0-100)** to tell you who is the best match!

## 🛠️ For the Tech Wizards (Developers)

If you want to know how it works inside:

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (The pretty face)
*   **Backend:** Node.js (The connection)
*   **AI Engine:** Python + Sentence Transformers (The thinking part)
*   **Database:** MongoDB (Where we keep the info)

We used **Vector Search** (math with arrows) to find the best matches. It's like finding two stars that are close to each other in the sky. ✨
